module: eos_command
short_description: Communicate with Arista EOS nodes over eAPI
description:
  - Provides a module for sending and receiving commands to Arista EOS
    nodes over eAPI.  This module does not provide idempotent operations.
    author: Arista EOS+
notes:
requirements:
  - Arista EOS 4.12.0 or later
  - EOS command API enabled
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - The list of commands to be sent to the node
    required: true
    aliases: []
  eapi_hostname:
    description:
      - The IP address or DNS hostname of the EOS device to be managed.  If
        local_connection is used, then this value must be configured.  When
        not using local_connection, this value does not need to be supplied
        and defaults to 'localhost'
    required: false
    default: 'localhost'
    aliases: []
  eapi_username:
    description:
      - The username to use for calls to eAPI.  If the username is not
        specified, then the default is used
    required: false
    default: 'admin'
    alias: []
  eapi_password:
    description:
      - The password to use for calls to eAPI.  If the password is not
        specified then the default is used ('')
    required: false
    default: ''
    alias: []
  eapi_protocol:
    description:
      - Configures the transport for connection to eAPI for either local
        or remote connections.  This value should be the same as shown
        from the output of 'show management api http-commands'
    require: false
    default: 'https'
    choices: ['http', 'https']
    alias: []
  eapi_port:
    description:
      - Configures the port used ifor connecting to eAPI for either local
        or remote connections.  This value should be the same as shown
        from the output of 'show management api http-commands'
      - If no value is specified, the the port is automatically determined
        based on the setting of eapi_protocol (http=80, https=443).
      - The value for this attribute must be in the range of 1 to 65535
